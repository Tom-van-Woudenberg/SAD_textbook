## Biaxial Bending 
In deriving the Flexure Formula for Symmetric Bending, a number of major assumptions about the beam geometry and loading were made. These assumptions greatly simplified the derivation of the formula; however, they also limit the general applicability of the resulting formula. We will systematically relax some of these assumptions in order to obtain more generalized formulas for bending of beams.
