# Bending



## Conventions and Assumptions
Although we will be looking at various cases for bending within this chapter, there are some common conventions and assumptions that we will be making that are stated here. 

First, recall the sign convention for internal forces and moments in a beam with an axis parallel to the $z$-coordinate direction illustrated in Fig. {numref}`Fig:SignConv`. In this chapter, we will be limiting our viewpoint to the bending moments $M_x$ and $M_y$. Note the directions of $M_x$ and $M_y$ and review the earlier chapter on internal loading for a detailed explanation of the convention used for positive forces and moments.
