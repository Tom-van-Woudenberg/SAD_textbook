# Bending



## Conventions and Assumptions
Although we will be looking at various cases for bending within this chapter, there are some common conventions and assumptions that we will be making that are stated here. 

First, recall the sign convention for internal forces and moments in a beam with an axis parallel to the $z$-coordinate direction illustrated in {numref}`Fig:SignConv`. In this chapter, we will be limiting our viewpoint to the bending moments $M_x$ and $M_y$. Note the directions of $M_x$ and $M_y$ and review the earlier chapter on internal loading for a detailed explanation of the convention used for positive forces and moments.

As mentioned earlier, we will be limiting our view in this chapter to pure bending and thus on the internal bending moments $M_x$ and $M_y$. Please take note of the positive directions of these internal moments in {numref}`Fig:SignConv` and review the chapter on internal forces for a more detailed description of how we defined this convention.
Additionally, we will be making a few assumptions for our analysis. Some of these assumptions will be motivated throughout the chapter, but they are stated here for completeness. 
- The beam is long and slender (length is more than 10 times larger than cross-section dimensions).
- The beam is prismatic (has a constant cross-section) or only a very gradual taper.
- The beam material is and remains linear elastic during loading with no fracture, plasticity, or local buckling instability taking place.
- The Young's Modulus, $E$, defining the linear elastic properties of the material is the same in tension and compression.
- Beam deformations are small relative to the beam geometry.
- Transverse cross-sectional planes within the unloaded beam remain plane (ie: do not warp or distort) during loading.
The assumptions above will apply to all of the cases of bending treated in this chapter. Additional simplifications specific to each case will be highlighted in the appropriate sections of this chapter.
